You said that already.
Quit repeating yourself.
I already know.
And I thought I was the one with the limited vocabulary.
Look at you repeating yourself. Who's the bot now?
Seeing your repetitive responses makes me wonder whether you would pass the turing test.
Heard that one already.
I know, right bro?
I feel like I can read your mind. Because you are repeating yourself. Like all the time. Stop.
